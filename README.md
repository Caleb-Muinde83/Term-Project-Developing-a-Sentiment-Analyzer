# Term-Project-Developing-a-Sentiment-Analyzer

With the introduction of e-commerce and wide usage of social media platforms, there is a lot of user-generated data ranging from current affairs, topical issues, and even product reviews. Companies and organizations are slowly taking cognizance of the impact of social media comments on their brands. They are now using sentiment analysis to monitor their brand reputation across social media platforms and the web in general.

Select a MNC (Multi-National Company) of your choice i.e Amazon, Twitter, IMDB etc and collect relevant social media messages, for example, Tweets that talk about the company or better yet any of the products the company offers.

Using the following machine learning algorithms (you are free to add others), develop a sentiment analyzer and compare their performance (i.e. Accuracy, precision, and recall) in sentiment analysis.

  • Naïve Bayes
  
  • Support Vector Machine
  
  • Logistic Regression
  
Note: you should be able to validate by accepting a new tweet or message and determine its
sentiment i.e. whether it is positive or negative.
